Handles form submissions to search for an app in either the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or both.  
Based on the search, it queries the corresponding MongoDB collections (`googleplaystore` and `applestore`) using a case-insensitive regex.  
If the app is found, random feedback is selected from the loaded feedback data, and sentiment analysis is performed using the `get_sentiment()` function.  
The results are rendered on the `app.html` page.

## HeloAI Chatbot (/heloai)
**@app.route("/heloai", methods=["POST"])**:  
This route accepts POST requests with user input (question), invokes the HeloAI chatbot using the `chain.invoke()` method, and returns the chatbot's response as a JSON object.

## Analysis Page (/analysis)
**@app.route('/analysis')**:  
Loads and processes data using the `load_and_process_data()` function from the analysis module.  
Renders the `analysis.html` template with processed data such as genre counts for both stores.

## About Us Page (/about-us)
**@app.route('/about-us')**:  
Renders the `about_us.html` template.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Page (/eda)
**@app.route('/eda')**:  
Performs EDA using the `perform_eda()` function from the Eda module, which analyzes the data in MongoDB.  
Renders the results in the `eda.html` template, displaying accuracy and classification reports for both stores.

# 7. Templating and Dynamic Content :paperclip:
- The page uses Jinja2 templating (e.g., `{{ playstore_info['App'] }}`) to inject dynamic content from the Flask backend into the HTML. This allows for server-side rendering of app data, sentiment results, and error messages based on the user's input.

# 8. Conditional Rendering :paperclip:
- The use of `{% if %}` and `{% endif %}` allows for conditional rendering of content, such as displaying the comparison view only when apps from both stores are found.

___
## `App.js` 
# JavaScript Code Explanation :paperclip:
This JavaScript code is designed to perform two main tasks on your web page:

## Display the Current Date and Time :paperclip:
- **`updateDateTime` Function:**
  - The `updateDateTime` function gets the current date and time, formats it, and then updates the corresponding HTML elements (`#date` and `#time`) every second.
  - This function is initially called when the DOM is fully loaded, and then continuously updates the date and time using `setInterval`.

## Fetch and Render Charts for App Store Data :paperclip:
- **`fetchDataAndRenderCharts` Function:**
  - This function fetches data from API endpoints for both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store and then renders bar charts using Chart.js.

### Google Play Store Chart: :paperclip:
- The data is fetched from the `/api/playstore_top_apps` endpoint.
- A bar chart is rendered showing the number of reviews for the top apps.

### Apple App Store Chart: :paperclip:
- The data is fetched from the `/api/applestore_top_apps` endpoint.
- A bar chart is rendered showing the total rating count for the top apps.

## Key Components of the Code: :clipboard:

### `DOMContentLoaded` Event: :paperclip:
- `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () { ... });` ensures that the functions `updateDateTime` and `fetchDataAndRenderCharts` are executed only after the entire DOM has been loaded.

### `updateDateTime` Function: :paperclip:
- The `now` object represents the current date and time.
- The `toLocaleDateString` and `toLocaleTimeString` methods are used to format the date and time based on the user's locale.
- The formatted date and time are then inserted into the respective HTML elements (`#date` and `#time`).

### Chart Rendering: :paperclip:
- The `fetchDataAndRenderCharts` function checks if the HTML elements for the charts (`#playstoreChart` and `#applestoreChart`) are present on the page.
- If the element exists, it fetches data from the relevant API endpoint, processes the data, and uses Chart.js to create a bar chart.
- The charts' appearance (colors, labels, borders) and options (e.g., starting Y-axis at zero) are configured in the Chart object.

### Error Handling: :paperclip:
- The `.catch(error => console.error('Error fetching ...'))` segments log any errors that occur during the data fetching process.

### Integration Considerations: :paperclip:
- Ensure that the HTML elements with IDs `#date`, `#time`, `#playstoreChart`, and `#applestoreChart` exist in the HTML file where this JavaScript is being used.
- The Chart.js library should be included in the HTML file before this script is loaded.
- The APIs `/api/playstore_top_apps` and `/api/applestore_top_apps` should return data in a format that matches the expected structure in the script.


This HTML template is well-organized and integrates with the Flask backend to provide a seamless experience for users searching for app information and sentiment analysis. The external CSS and JavaScript files help maintain a clean separation of concerns for styling and interactivity.
